#using Jupyter Notebook as a cloud based service - made available by deepnote.com - based on jupyter notebook
#Jupyter notebook is an IDE where you write a code
#different from standard IDEs because

#A Project creates the notebook - it consists of cells
#Cells are like python scripts - each cell serves as a separate script
#You run each cell - output directly shows below the cell
#You can still access the variables of other cells from others

#Also Blocks- to add headers subheaders etc. to your notebook

#It is cloud-based so this notebook can be shared with other people

#You can also install and import third party libraries - no problem with it, you can use them on notebook
